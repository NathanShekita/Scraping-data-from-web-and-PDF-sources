# Scrape data from PDFs
Sometimes interesting data are only available in PDFs. In this repository, I extract crime data in New Haven, CT provided in weekly PDFs by the NHPD. I also scrape and format data (possibly) related to crime, such as hours of daylight, unemployment claims, and COVID outbreaks. 

Still a work in progress!
